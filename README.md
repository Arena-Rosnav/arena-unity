# Arena Unity
Unity Simulator for [Arena Rosnav](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav/arena-rosnav). The executable will be implemented there as a simulator.

## Getting Started
You will need the [Arena Rosnav Main Repo](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav/arena-rosnav) too if you want to use the Simulator.

## Controls
When running the simulator in development mode (in the Game Tab) or executing the build, inside of the simulation use following controls:
**WASD**: Just like in any other application  
**Q**: Move Down  
**E**: Move Up
