The mdns library is an optional dependency, which is included for this example only. The mdns library has been modified
slightly to work with unity (mostly logging adjustments).

The newest version of the library can be acquired here: https://github.com/richardschneider/net-mdns
The license is MIT.

If you don't want to include the dead zip in your project, just remove the example directory from the project.
